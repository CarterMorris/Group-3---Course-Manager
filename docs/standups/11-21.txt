Name: Carter Morris

What have you done since yesterday?
    - Fixed Back button bugs that would allow a user to sign in with any random login info after signing in properly and pressing the back button
    
What are you planning on doing today?
    - Implement behaviour for when the user input wrong information and tries to sign in (wrong username wrong password, right username wrong password, wrong username right password)

Any impediments or stumbling blocks?
    - None
