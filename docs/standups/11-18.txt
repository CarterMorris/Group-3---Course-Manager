Name: Carter Morris

What have you done since yesterday?
    - Synched Github to Android studio and pulled the default LoginActivity made

What are you planning on doing today?
    - Add functionality to "Sign in or Register Button" to open a new activity for students (default)
    - Figure out colour scheme

Any impediments or stumbling blocks?
    - Need to begin the database work to determine if after clicking the "Sign in or Regsiter" button we want to open an activity for students or admins
