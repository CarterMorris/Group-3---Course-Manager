What have you done since yesterday?
    - Added an Admin landing page with a separate theme (new drawable for background)
    - Added back buttons on the student and admin landing pages to go back to the login page
    - Added functionality to the login in button so that if a valid login is entered, the user is sent to the corresponding page
    
What are you planning on doing today?
    - Fix back button bugs

Any impediments or stumbling blocks?
    - None
